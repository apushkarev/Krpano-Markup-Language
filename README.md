* Color theme "May Thunderstorm" for ST optimized to highlight KML code;
* Python Script to remove comments from src.

## Installation ##

1. Clone or download this repo to some location;
2. Find `dist` folder in package and open it's contents;
3. Open Sublime Text, run Preferences â€“> Browse Packages...;
4. Navigate to User folder;
5. Copy contents of `dist` folder into opened User folder;
6. Restart ST if required.

## Features ##

**I.**	Syntax definition is based on [official krpano documentation](http://krpano.com/docu), [plugin](http://krpano.com/plugins/) docs and is intended to recognize all structural entities(e.g. elements, properties or keywords) of KML.

Current list of recognized entities includes:
* Operators (`( ) [ ] . , ; == === != !== < > <= >= ! AND OR LT GT LE GE`). Each operator used in code must be separated from operands by spaces;
* Instruction words (see [Programming logic/Flow control](http://krpano.com/docu/actions/#actionsreference) section of krpano docs);
* Basic functions (all other pre-defined functions);
* [Global Variables](http://krpano.com/docu/actions/#globalvarsreference);
* Named constants;
* Pre-defined [elements](http://krpano.com/docu/xml);
* Pre-defined element properties;
* Action arguments;
* Hex numbers prefixed by 0x or #;
* Decimal numbers including % values;
* Single-line string constants;
* Single-line comments(following // until the end of the line**(1)**);
* XML tags.

**1. Since comments are not supported niether in actions nor in event handlers they should be removed from source code before execution.**

**II.**	May Thunderstorm is user-defined color theme for ST3 based on [Seti Monokai dark color scheme](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui) so it supports any other language. Syntax definition also works nicely with Twilight theme. Unfortunately, Monokai would not be supported.

**III.**	removeComments.py script removes single-line comments from KML source. This operation is required for correct code exec.

Requires [python environment](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

At one call comments from one file are removed.

Usage:
	`python script_dir/remove_comments.py src_dir src_file output_dir1 output_dir2`

## Modifying ##
 
See [Syntax Definitions](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html) chapter of ST unofficial manual,
use the same process to modify color scheme.
